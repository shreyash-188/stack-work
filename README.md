1. Project Title
Recipe Sharing – Privacy-Preserving Proof of Completion

2. Project Description
This project allows users to submit and verify proofs of recipe completion on the Stacks blockchain without revealing the actual recipe.
Each proof is stored as a hash commitment — ensuring privacy while still enabling verification.
Chefs or learners can prove they’ve completed a recipe by sharing only the proof hash with verifiers.

3. Project Vision
To create a trustless, transparent, and privacy-preserving recipe sharing ecosystem where creators can certify that learners have completed their recipes without revealing secret ingredients or methods.

4. Future Scope
Add zero-knowledge proof verification for advanced privacy.

Include NFT rewards for completed recipes.

Implement expiration dates and revocation of proofs.

Integrate with Decentralized Identity (DID) for verified profiles.

Allow tiered access to premium recipes upon proof verification.

5. Contract Address

(Replace with actual address after deployment on Stacks testnet or mainnet)
